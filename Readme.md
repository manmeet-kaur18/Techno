## **Your College Partner**

Techno is a web portal for the college students and faculty to manage and track their academics related activities efficiently and helps them save a lot of time.Usually in a college for a particular year there are 2 semesters that is even and odd. There are various branchs in the college and their ID needs to be unique. There are also different CourseIDs which also needs to be unique.There are also students who have unique ids which is there roll no to identify them in college. There are faculties who also have unique IDs in college. Going on further, there are semesters according to the students which can be (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) where 1 denotes 1st year odd sem, 2 denotes 1st year even sem, 3 denotes 2nd year odd sem, 4 denotes 2nd year even sem and so on.

Now in a particular Year and ODD semester different students can be in 1st,3rd,5th,7th,9th sem. Similarly, in a particular Year and EVEN semester different students can be in 2nd,4th,6th,8th,10th sem. So, we can come to conclusion that the batchID can be same when student semesters (1,2,..,10) are different but BatchID cannot be same in same student semester i.e, (1,2,..,10) and same year. 

**So, to manage so many students who belong to different batches in various student semester and year and maintaining record of various faculties about the Batches and Courses they taught in each Semester and Year seem to be quite difficult but this where Techno sorts the things out and makes it possible in it.**
